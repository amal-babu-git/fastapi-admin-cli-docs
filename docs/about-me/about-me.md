Hi, I am Amal Babu.

> In most of my projects, I've relied heavily on Django—especially with Django REST Framework for APIs, paired with React or Next.js on the frontend.
>
> For years, I'd been hearing great things about FastAPI. Its modern, Pythonic syntax, built-in async support, and strong performance really caught my attention. I finally gave it a shot recently—and I absolutely loved it.
>
> That said, I missed Django's modular structure and the developer-friendly manage.py commands. So, I built a Django-style setup in FastAPI using SQLAdmin for the admin panel, Alembic for database migrations, and FastAPI-Users for authentication.
>
> While this structure worked well, repeating the same setup for every new project started to feel tedious. To solve this personal pain point, I created fastapi-admin-cli—a simple CLI tool that brings Django-like commands to FastAPI. It supports startproject (with built-in auth and admin panel) and startapp, helping me spin up new projects much faster.

> I decided to publish it on PyPI, hoping it might help others like me who love structure and speed in their FastAPI projects.
