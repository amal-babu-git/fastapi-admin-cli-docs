Hi, I am Amal Babu

> I've been using Django in almost all the projects I've worked on, typically combining Django REST Framework (DRF) for APIs and React or Next.js for the frontend.
>
> Over the last three years, I've read a lot about FastAPI—its modern, Pythonic development style, excellent performance, asynchronous support, and great documentation. I finally gave it a try recently, and it's awesome.
>
> However, I prefer following a proper modular structure in my projects. Django's app system and its manage.py CLI are very developer-friendly. So, I adopted a Django-style modular approach in FastAPI using SQLAdmin for the admin panel, Alembic for database migrations and FastAPI-Users for authentication.
>
> While this setup works well, creating modules and setting up authentication repeatedly for new projects became tedious. To streamline my workflow, I built fastapi-admin-cli—a CLI tool with commonly used Django-like commands for FastAPI. It supports startproject (with auth and admin panel) and startapp, making project setup easier and faster.
